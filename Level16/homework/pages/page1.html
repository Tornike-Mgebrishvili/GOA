        <h2>Premise</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>In a nightmarish town somewhere in the United States that traps those who enter, unwilling residents strive
            to stay alive, plagued by terrifying nocturnal creatures from the surrounding forest, and search for a way
            out, looking for secrets hidden within the town and beyond.

            The series centers around Boyd Stevens (Perrineau), the self-appointed Sheriff and de-facto mayor, and the
            Matthews family, new arrivals to the town who soon discover that they are trapped along with the other
            existing residents, and must work together to stay alive and find a way to escape.</p>
